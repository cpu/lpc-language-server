LPC Language Server

## Running

There are currently two launch configs set up:

1. To launch the vscode extension host, which creates a language client, runs the server, and connects.
2. To run bin.ts using node - for quick debugging and testing of things.

Todo: Add a way to run just the language server, for use with editors other than VSCode.

## Grammar ToDo's
